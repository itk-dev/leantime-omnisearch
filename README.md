# Leantime OmniSearch

A plugin for Leantime that gives access to a plethora of shortcuts, to speed up 
navigating the system.

## Development

This plugin requires an instance of Leantime running locally.

Git clone this repo into app/Plugins as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ITK-Leantime/leantime-omnisearch app/Plugins/OmniSearch  
```

Install the plugin through Leantime in your web browser.

The install process symlinks the plugin assets to
public/dist/css/omniSearch.css and public/dist/js/omniSearch.js
respectively, which are the files loaded in the frontend.

Changes should be made to the plugin assets files.

### Coding standards

Run prettier via the following command:

```shell
    docker run -it --volume ${PWD}:/app --rm node:20 yarn --cwd /app install
    docker run -it --volume ${PWD}:/app --rm node:20 yarn --cwd /app prettier assets --fix --write
```
